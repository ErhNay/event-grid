# EventGrid (Desktop-First Project,multi-page UI, Responsive Website)

## EventGrids, the UI of a multi-page, real-world and a truly fully-fledged website.
This project uses desktop-first design paradigm, in which the creation and design process start off from a larger screen and , the screen's size shrinks consequently. It is very responsive and leverages certain CSS design techniques (flexbox and css-grid) to design the entire website's layout. I had a lot of fun building this site. Feel free to have a look at the codes. Below are screenshots of a section of the site with their responsive view.
